                I am a person who is ready to learn anything from anyone without any hesitancy. Being a quick learner is my strength. And I give importance to everyone and each individual as their own strength I try to get inspired by them. A true inspiration for me is my friend who is a hard worker and self-motivated person who guides me in all aspects.I engage myself in activities like swimming, cooking, meditation, drawing, listening to music etc. My weakness is I used to get emoted quickly when some of the incidents that I come across, But now, I have managed it a lot by the guidance of my friends and by reading self-help books and Podcasts.
                Thank you.
